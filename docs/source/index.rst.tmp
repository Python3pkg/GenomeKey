Description
============

This whole genome analysis pipeline is python package that aligns next generation sequence reads
to a reference genome, and implements the GATK Best Practices v4 to do alignment cleaning and
variant calling.  It is a Cosmos workflow, and so is able to take advantage of a compute
cluster with a distributed resource management system installed such as LSF, Grid Engine,
or Condor.  All Job informatin and resource usage are stored in the Cosmos SQL database.  The workflow
is capable of processing many gene panels, exomes and whole genomes worth of genomic next generation
sequencing data.
